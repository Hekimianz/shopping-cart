# Shopping Cart

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum. It is a mock shopping app, where a user can select items, and add them to their shopping cart.

The main purpose of this project is to practice React Routing and React in general.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
